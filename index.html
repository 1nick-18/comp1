    <h1>The Hidden Cost Of Social Media Censorship</h1>
    <p>How Social Media Censorship Impacts Teen Mental Health</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>As social media platforms moderate content more aggressively, teens are caught in the middle â€” silenced, shadowbanned, or discouraged from expressing mental health struggles. This project explores how censorship affects the well-being of young people online.</p>

      <h2>Key Statistic</h2>
      <div class="stat">ðŸ“Š Teens exposed to cyberbullying or harmful content on social media without moderation were twice as likely to experience symptoms of depression or anxiety compared to those who reported strong content filtering or support tools. (Source: Pew Research)</div>

      <h2>Personal Stories</h2>
      <div class="quote">
        "I used to spend hours on Instagram and TikTok, comparing my life to everyone else's. Everyone looked like they had perfect skin, cute outfits, exciting lives. I started to hate my reflection and think I was boring. One day, I deleted all my apps for a week just to breathe. I realized Iâ€™d been letting curated posts define how I felt about myself. Now, I post less and scroll with more awareness. Still hard sometimes, but better." â€“ Anonymous teen</div>

      <h2>Whats the SOLUTION?!?</h2>
      <p>We need mental health treatment, not silence. Join the conversation, advocate for transparency in moderation, and stand with teens who are trying to be heard. Every voice matters. When platforms don't do enough to protect young people from toxic content, we all need to step up and demand better. Speak out, share tools, hold tech accountableâ€”and most importantly, remind teens they're not alone. Together we can build safer digital spaces that make solutions, not harm.</p>
